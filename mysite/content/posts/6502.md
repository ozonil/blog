I've been thinking about a good programming project to undertake and found that NESdev can be fun and challenging . First some resources:

[https://famicom.party](famicom.party) a handholding (in a very good way) resouce starting from the basics. Though the final few chapters are yet to come.

[https://www.youtube.com/@NesHacker](NesHacker) is a youtube channel on NES architecture and postmortems of popular games. Quality videos on the subject.


[Nes Wiki](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Nesdev_Wiki) is, well a wiki on all things NES. Highly recommended by NES devs.

[8-bit workshop](https://8bitworkshop.com/) provides an entire development suite from the emulator to code editor and a sprite editor.
