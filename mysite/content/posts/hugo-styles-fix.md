Browser inspector tools are great as this [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46548205) demonstrates. A simple '/' missing in your config and your CSS is messed up. Fixed the bug. CSS applies to the website now. Kinda neat.

[the commit](https://github.com/ozonil/blog/commit/85c412fc1fe0e9041cd64d9b954266534d686e4a)

I could imagine a time when this fix wouldn't have come. I would have other 'priorities' and abandon the whole endevour and delete the repo in a few months after it stales.

Hopefully that changes.
