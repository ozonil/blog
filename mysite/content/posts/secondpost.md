Immediate followup. CSS is messed up after deployment. Must have something to do with how I *didn't* do something. It still looks pretty though. Time to let it go and move on to more immediate commitments.

The time it takes to move from creating a new post with `hugo new post/post.md` with editing the generated page, adding, commiting and pushing is so low that I should be able to crank out posts fast. Never realized the process would be so fluid. Working on a linux machine after battling with windows for the last few months sure feels good.
