Things I learned today:
1. Changing ownership of files: `sudo chown ozonil:ozonil foo.txt`
2. Writing files in vim: `:w path/to/directory/filename.txt`. I can't imagine how I missed that. Fundamental. But I was never a heavy vim user so forgivable I guess.
3. Setting up tags in hugo from this [blog](https://www.jakewiesler.com/blog/hugo-taxonomies). Got to learn about custom variables and a bit about the hugo templating.
4. tar unzipping files from the terminal: `tar -xf file.tar.gz`.
5. shortcuts for navigating man pages: 'n' to scroll to next line and 'y' to scroll to previous line.

And a lot of practice navigating through the file system and file editing workflow.

Just sitting down on my desk, my dining table ;) and working on something with intent has helped me learn things that I wouldn't have learned until a later point of time. Doing this regularly will help increase confidence in myself and my learning process I believe.

This might be too early to draw conclusions but writing this blog is helping me stay accountable. If I don't do at least some semi-productive work, what am I gonna write? Will definitely make an effort to write something down everyday.
